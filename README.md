# Sepsis-Mortality
Sepsis Mortality prediction using machine learning method
## Background information
This study presents a breakthrough in predicting sepsis outcomes by analyzing adult sepsis cases from the MIMIC-IV database, where a carefully curated set of 38 features was used to train various classification models. The Random Forest algorithm, with an AUROC of 0.94, outshined previous models, offering enhanced accuracy and interpretabilityâ€”a leap forward from prior research. The integration of SHAP values provided deeper insights into influential predictors, such as coma scores and urine output, bolstering the role of machine learning in improving clinical decisions and potentially reducing sepsis-related mortality.
## Tools and Language used:
Google BigQuery for data extraction
Python(juypter notebook) for data preprocessing and model fitting.
